**Steps:**
1. Create a function named findLongestWord.
2. Split the sentence into words by considering spaces as delimiters.
3. Iterate through each word and keep track of the longest word encountered.
4. Return the longest word.
5. Test the findLongestWord function in the main function with various sentences.
