**Objective:** Implement a function that prints the Fibonacci sequence using a for loop.

**Steps:**
1. Create a function named fibonacci.
2. Initialize two variables to represent the first two numbers in the sequence.
3. Use a for loop to generate the next numbers in the sequence by adding the last two numbers.
4. Print each number inside the loop.
5. Test the fibonacci function in the main function to print the first 10 numbers in the sequence.
