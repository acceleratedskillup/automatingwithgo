**Objective:** Implement a function that checks if a string is a palindrome using a for loop.

**Steps:**
1. Create a function named isPalindrome.
2. Use a for loop to compare characters from the start and end of the string.
3. If any characters don't match, return false.
4. If all characters match, return true.
5. Test the isPalindrome function in the main function with various strings.
