**Objective:**
The space center's main control system sometimes fails to initialize certain settings. To prevent system crashes, you decide to implement nil pointer checks.

**Steps:**
1. Declare a pointer to a string without initializing it.
2. Check if the pointer is nil before dereferencing.
3. Print a message if the setting is not initialized.
