**Objective:**
The space center is analyzing data from multiple telescopes. Each telescope sends an array of data points. To manage these data points efficiently, you decide to use pointers with arrays.

**Steps:**
1. Declare an integer array representing data points from a telescope.
2. Declare a pointer to the array.
3. Update the first data point using the pointer.
4. Print the updated data points.
