**Objective:**
The space center is planning a mission to Mars. You're tasked with managing the astronaut profiles. To ensure efficient memory usage, you decide to use pointers with structs.

**Steps:**
1. Declare an `Astronaut` struct with fields `Name` and `Age`.
2. Create a pointer to an `Astronaut` struct and initialize it.
3. Update the `Name` and `Age` fields using the pointer.
4. Print the updated astronaut details.
