**Objective:**
The space center is receiving signals from a distant star. The signals are represented as integers. To ensure you're working with the original signal data and not a copy, you decide to use pointer dereferencing.

**Steps:**
1. Declare an integer variable representing the signal strength.
2. Declare a pointer for the signal strength.
3. Update the signal strength using the pointer.
4. Print the updated signal strength.
