**Objective:**
The space center's mainframe computer has a unique memory management system. As part of a troubleshooting team, you are tasked with understanding the arithmetic operations performed by the system using pointers. To replicate a specific scenario, you need to create a program that performs arithmetic operations using pointers.

**Steps:**
1. Declare two integer pointers `pA` and `pB` with some initial values.
2. Calculate the sum of the dereferenced values of `pA` and `pB`.
3. Print the result.
