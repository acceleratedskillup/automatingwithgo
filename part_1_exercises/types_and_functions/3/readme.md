**Objective:**
In a world of magic and alchemy, you're an alchemist with a unique recipe for a potion that grants invisibility. Model this potion and its interactions.

Design a `Potion` class that represents the invisibility potion. The potion should have properties indicating its potency and duration, and methods to drink it and experience its effects.

**Steps:**
1. Define a `Potion` struct with properties like `potency`, `duration`, and `quantity`.
2. Implement methods to drink the potion and describe its effects.
3. In the main function, brew the potion, drink it, and narrate the experience.
