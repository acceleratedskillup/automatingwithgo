**Objective:**
You're a curator at a virtual art gallery. The gallery features artworks from various artists and epochs. Model this virtual gallery and its interactions.

Design a `Gallery` class that represents the virtual art space. The gallery should feature artworks, each with properties like `title`, `artist`, and `epoch`. Implement methods to display the artworks, add new pieces, and search for specific artworks.

**Steps:**
1. Define an `Artwork` struct with properties like `title`, `artist`, and `epoch`.
2. Define a `Gallery` struct that contains a slice of `Artwork`.
3. Implement methods to manage and interact with the artworks.
4. In the main function, curate the gallery, add artworks, display them, and search for specific pieces.
