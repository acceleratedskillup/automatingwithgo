**Objective:**
You've stumbled upon a time machine! However, it's not as simple as pressing a button. The machine requires specific coordinates in the fabric of time. Model this machine and travel through time.

Design a `TimeMachine` class that can set temporal coordinates and transport you to different eras.

**Steps:**
1. Define a `TimeMachine` struct with properties like `destinationYear`, `currentYear`, and `fuel`.
2. Implement methods to set the destination, calculate fuel consumption, and travel through time.
3. In the main function, set your desired year, check if you have enough fuel, and if so, embark on your time-traveling adventure.
