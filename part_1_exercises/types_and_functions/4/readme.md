**Objective:**
In a land of myths, there's a dragon guarding a vast treasure. Model this dragon, its lair, and the interactions an adventurer might have with it.

Design a `Dragon` class that represents the mighty beast. The dragon should have properties indicating its strength, treasure, and mood. Implement methods for an adventurer to approach the dragon, attempt to take its treasure, or try to befriend it.

**Steps:**
1. Define a `Dragon` struct with properties like `strength`, `treasureAmount`, and `mood`.
2. Implement methods for an adventurer's interactions: approach, takeTreasure, and befriend.
3. In the main function, play out a scenario where an adventurer encounters the dragon and decides on an action.
