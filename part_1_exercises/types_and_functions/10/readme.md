**Objective:**
Artificial intelligence is reshaping the world. You're an AI researcher working on neural networks. Model a basic neural network and train it on mock data.

Design a `NeuralNetwork` class that represents a basic AI model. The network should have layers and neurons. Implement methods to feed data into the network, train it, and predict outcomes.

**Steps:**
1. Define a `NeuralNetwork` struct with properties like `layers` and `neuronsPerLayer`.
2. Implement methods to feed data, train the network, and make predictions.
3. In the main function, create a neural network, train it on mock data, and make predictions.
