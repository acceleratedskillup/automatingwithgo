**Objective:**
Deep within the Enchanted Forest lies a magical tree known as the Whispering Willow. This tree holds ancient secrets. Your task is to model the Whispering Willow and interact with its magic.

Design a `Tree` class that represents the Whispering Willow. The tree should be able to whisper secrets and change its appearance based on seasons.

**Steps:**
1. Define a `Tree` struct with properties like `age`, `season`, and `secrets`.
2. Implement methods to whisper its secrets and change its appearance based on the season.
3. In the main function, interact with the Whispering Willow, listen to its secrets, and observe its transformation across seasons.
