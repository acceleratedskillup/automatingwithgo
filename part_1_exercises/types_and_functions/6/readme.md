**Objective:**
The universe is filled with celestial bodies that move in harmony, creating a cosmic symphony. Model a solar system with planets that have their own unique orbits and characteristics.

Design a `SolarSystem` class that represents a miniature universe. Each planet in the solar system should have properties like `name`, `distanceFromSun`, and `orbitalPeriod`. Implement methods to display the details of each planet and simulate their orbits.

**Steps:**
1. Define a `Planet` struct with properties like `name`, `distanceFromSun`, and `orbitalPeriod`.
2. Define a `SolarSystem` struct that contains a slice of `Planet`.
3. Implement methods to display planet details and simulate their orbits.
4. In the main function, create a solar system, add planets to it, and simulate the cosmic dance.
