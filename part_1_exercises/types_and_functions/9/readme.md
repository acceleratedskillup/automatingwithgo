**Objective:**
Quantum computing is the frontier of modern computation. You've been given access to a prototype quantum computer. Model this computer and run basic quantum algorithms on it.

Design a `QuantumComputer` class that represents the prototype machine. The computer should be able to run quantum algorithms, represented as strings. Implement methods to load algorithms, run them, and display their results.

**Steps:**
1. Define a `QuantumComputer` struct with properties like `qubits` and `algorithm`.
2. Implement methods to load quantum algorithms, run them, and display results.
3. In the main function, interact with the quantum computer, load algorithms, and observe the quantum magic.
