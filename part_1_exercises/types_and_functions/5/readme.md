**Steps:**
1. Define a `Tomb` struct with properties like `currentChamber` and a map of `chambers` with their respective riddles.
2. Implement methods to navigate through the chambers and solve riddles.
3. In the main function, explore the tomb, solve the riddles, and discover the Pharaoh's treasure.
