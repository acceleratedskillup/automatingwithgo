**Objective:** You're temporarily cataloging some rare books in the library. Instead of creating a permanent struct definition, use an anonymous struct.

**Steps:**
1. In the `main` function, define and initialize an anonymous struct for a rare book.
2. The struct should have fields: `Title`, `Author`, and `EstimatedValue`.
3. Print the details of the rare book.
