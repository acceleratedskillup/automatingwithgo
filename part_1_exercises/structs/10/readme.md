**Objective:** The library system now wants to include details about the book's edition. Implement this feature using nested struct embedding.

**Steps:**
1. Define a struct named `Edition` with fields: `Number` and `Year`.
2. Embed the `Edition` struct inside the `Book` struct.
3. In the `main` function, initialize a book with edition details using struct literals.
4. Print the book details along with its edition details.
