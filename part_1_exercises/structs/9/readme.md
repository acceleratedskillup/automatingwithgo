**Objective:** You're enhancing the library system to include publishers for books. Use anonymous fields to achieve this.

**Steps:**
1. Define a struct named `Publisher` with a field: `Name`.
2. Embed the `Publisher` struct inside the `Book` struct as an anonymous field.
3. In the `main` function, initialize a book with a publisher using struct literals.
4. Print the book details along with its publisher.
