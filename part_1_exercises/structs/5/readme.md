**Objective:** The library wants to keep track of all borrowers for a specific book. Implement this feature using a slice within a struct.

**Steps:**
1. Define a struct named `Borrower` with fields: `Name` and `DateBorrowed`.
2. In the `Book` struct, add a slice of `Borrower` to represent all the borrowers.
3. In the `main` function, initialize a book and add some borrowers to it.
4. Print the book details along with its borrowers.
