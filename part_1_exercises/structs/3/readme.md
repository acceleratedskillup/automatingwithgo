**Objective:** You're enhancing the library system. This time, you want to categorize books into genres. Use struct embedding to achieve this.

**Steps:**
1. Define a struct named `Genre` with a field: `Name`.
2. Embed the `Genre` struct inside the `Book` struct.
3. In the `main` function, initialize a book with a genre using struct literals.
4. Print the book details along with its genre.
