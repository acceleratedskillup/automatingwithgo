**Closures**

**Objective:** Learn about closures and how they can access and modify variables from an enclosing function.

**Steps:**

1. Define a function named counter.
2. This function should return another function.
3. The returned function should increment a count every time it's called.
4. In the main function, call the returned function multiple times and print the results.
